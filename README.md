# Maternal Health Risk Analysis

## 📖 Description

A project analyzing maternal health risk factors using machine learning algorithms to predict pregnancy complications.

## ⚙️ Technologies

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## 🛠️ Installation
- Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tedr5/maternal-health-risk.git
  ```
- Install the required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  ```
## 📊 Notebooks Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks focused on predicting maternal health risks:

- **MaternalHealthRisk1.ipynb**:
    - Utilizes K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and K-means clustering to analyze risk levels.
    - Compares the effectiveness of K-NN as a classifier and K-means for clustering.

- **MaternalHealthRisk2.ipynb**:
    - Explores K-NN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms for risk prediction.
    - Utilizes GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization and presents evaluation metrics for each model.

## 🚀 Features

- Data Visualization: Graphical representations of health metrics.
- Model Comparison: Insights into the performance of different algorithms.
- Predictive Modeling: Ability to predict risk levels based on patient data.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/863/maternal+health+risk 
consists of 7 variables about 1013 patients, including:

- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Body Temperature
- Heart Rate
- Glucose Level
- Risk Level (Low, Mid, High)
